# Time Bank
## Develhope team project - Java 4, Team 3
During our 6-month course at [Develhope](https://develhope.co/?utm_source=cpc&utm_medium=google&utm_campaign=SN_IT_it_PM&utm_content=&utm_term=&gclid=CjwKCAjwlqOXBhBqEiwA-hhitGTCsf6Jrq9gyQ3AVeXi4Ci54SGPSd-fkCtj4XO9E8FaXhUZMrLVmhoCdhYQAvD_BwE), we were given the opportunity to collaborate in a team project which consisted in the development of the back-end section of a web app.
## What is Time Bank?
Time Bank is a tool for a volunteering organization, where volunteers offer to share their time with people in need with different kinds of tasks.<br>
Requests are divided into categories depending on what kind of skills are required to finish the job (technical, educational, psychological, car-based, etc.).
## How does it work?
- People in need can post a request either as registered users, if they prefer having their data saved and want to make the process of posting a request faster, or as guests, if they prefer remaining anonymous.
- People who want to contribute as volunteers, have to register and get verified by an admin.
## Tools used in the development process
- Spring (Dependencies: Spring boot starter web, Lombok, Spring boot Maven plugin, Spring boot devtools, Spring boot starter test)
- RESTful APIs
- MySQL Database
